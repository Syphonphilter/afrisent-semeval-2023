We will show you anonymized tweets in Algerian Arabic. The tweets can be positive, negative, or neutral. 


*Examples*

- الحفلة كانت هايلة is a *positive* sentence, and the adjective هايلة indicates that.

- الحفلة كانت سامطة is a *negative* sentence, and the word سامطة indicates that.

- Factual sentences such as الحفلة كانت قدام الدار are *neutral* sentences.


In the same way, we would like you to point us to which word led you to annotate the tweet. Words can be tokens (up to 3 tokens), such as opinion words (e.g., I “love/hate/do not mind”...), adjectives (e.g., nice, okay, awful), or even emojis (e.g., 💌, :-D, :-(, … )

We have also added a comment column where you can share your thoughts, comments, or doubts. 

If you are unsure whether you should annotate the tweet as positive, negative, or neutral, you may choose the label that suits it best and a comment about that in the comment column. 

The annotation of a sarcastic tweet depends on the context. While we acknowledge the lack of context, if you think the tweet is mocking someone (or a group of people), you should label it negative.

*N.B.* Please flag any tweet that sounds offensive or hateful. We will delete them later.
